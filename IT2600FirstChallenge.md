Before I go any further, here's a [link to the README file](README.md "to the README")

My favorite languages include:
1. C
  * Because it was the first language I learned in college
  * And gave me the most headaches
2. Lua
  * Because it was the first language I learned outside college
  * And the syntax was perfect
3. Java
  * Because it's so versatile
4. HTML
  * Because it's fun (with CSS)


Here's a little snippet of print in first C, and then Java:
```C
printf("Hello World");
```
```java
System.out.print("Hello World");
```
